(8 minutes read)

By Group 1 from Viet Tech Mentorship 2023

Hi everyone👋, my name is Hiếu, nice to meet you all - I’m a mentee of Viet Tech mentorship program. Our team consists of Trang Vu , Minh Quân, Thanh Nguyen and I recently completed a group project called Bunny Lover which is a PERN stack web application that assists users in keeping track of their daily spending and financial budget.

Firstly, I’d love to give many appreciations, recognition and thanks to our mentors Anh Pham, Kevin Luu, Vũ Thanh Nguyên, Huy Anhh, Viettech admins/mods and specifically anh Khoa Le Thien for his dedication and willingness to share and support us regardless of whether it was night or day.

In this post, I’d love to share with you our journey from beginning to end. The information we present in this post is exclusively based on our experience as we build this web app.

<p class="text-secondary fst-italic">Disclaimer: The insights shared are based solely on our personal experiences gained from working on one full-stack group project. The information provided is intended to be particularly useful for individuals at the beginner level who might find it challenging to begin their journey.

### COME UP WITH AN IDEA:

🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸

This step is super important, consider all the aspects and select the one that you don’t have to waste your time to come back and change your idea.

Here’s one of the criteria that we’ve taken into consideration

How does this web app affect/contribute to society/community?

A project with limited resources so we can build from scratch and not rely on available resources.

Pros and cons of each web application based on the time constraints.

🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸🌸

1. We gathered as a full team and listed out all possible ideas that we could pursue for this project such as:

- E-commerce app
- Financial App
- Social Media App

2. After gathering those ideas, we identified strengths and weaknesses related to each project if we were going to implement it.

- For the E-commerce app: we identified that there were already lots of apps existing at that moment, therefore, it would be a duplicated project if we were to implement it
- For Financial app: We did research on the existing apps and we found out that those apps were available mostly on mobile but there were not lots of versions on the web. Therefore, we noted it as a potential project that needed further research.
- Social media apps: it was similar to E-commerce apps, there were already lots of versions of these apps on the Internet, therefore, there was not be lots of room for us to be creative with them.

3. After consulting with Khoa Le Thien, we decided to go with the idea of creating a Financial App because there would be room for us to be creative as well as learn more new stuff.
4. List out all main features of the app, also list out any unique/non-traditional feature that we can come up with (so it will be easier for the design stage)

### CHOOSE TECH STACKS

Initially, we sketched the UML diagram for our project with blocks to represent the front end and the backend based on the list of our features

Before choosing our tech stacks, we were given a chance to participate in useful workshops about ReactJS, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript hosted by Khoa to get hands-on experience about web development.

Then, our team brainstormed and decided to list out all the stacks possible and we chose to follow the PERN stack, including PostgreSQL, Express.js, ReactJS, and Node.js.

We opted for this particular tech stack due to our team's extensive familiarity with SQL, thus ensuring a seamless transition to PostgreSQL. The choice of React and Express is not only popular but also benefits from comprehensive full-ecosystem backing and most of the mentors are well-versed with this stack.

---

### ASSIGN ROLES

For choosing roles, at the very first meeting as a team, we shared each other’s experiences, interests, strengths, and weaknesses. Based on that, we chose the technology most fit with each person.

As for Trang Vu, she had some experience building front-end (but just basic HTML/CSS). Throughout the journey, we have improved ourselves a lot by taking advantage of the existing library to enhance UI, instead of styling raw in CSS

Thanh Nguyen has expressed an interest in the backend, therefore he was responsible for implementing API endpoints

Coming to our leader, Minh Quan, who was experienced in web development, wanted to work in DevOps by setting up Docker, which is useful when working as a team on different development environments and OS.

Later on, near the end of the project, after most of our features had been implemented successfully, we decided to mingle: the front-end team now switched to the backend and vice versa. We switch mostly to get all members to have exposure in both the front-end and back-end.

### DESIGN UI

I was responsible for designing the project's UI with Figma.

At first, I looked for some designs available on the Internet, which can be in Behance or Figma Community, where there are available themes or templates that I could take advantage of.

After sketching the UI on paper, then I transferred the drawing sketches to a low-fidelity prototype on Figma.

Another tip for transferring Figma design for web developers is that we can take advantage of the CSS styling code provided in Figma to style our website to match exactly the proposed design.

---

### SKETCH STUDY PLAN

We committed ourselves to 5 hours/week.

Github: Recognizing the varying levels of familiarity our members possess with GitHub, We decided to use the gitflow branching strategy for an easier time developing. Gitflow, an ingenious branching model, extends our capabilities in modern software engineering. By offering a structured approach to branching, release management, and bug fixing, Gitflow helps us to keep collaboration among our members.

Tech stacks: Quan proposed using the PERN stack. We spent the first month getting used to the React ecosystem while learning the foundation for JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We use courses from Coursera, O’reily, and spamming chat-gpt until we understand how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together. Fortunately, Khoa hosted a lot of workshops for React and shared resources, so we didn’t have to trial and experiment which would take forever. After a month or so we began to incorporate Express to write simple server logic interacting with PostgreSQL databases. Learning about middleware and some simple networking concepts has been helpful for our journey.

## PROJECT (2.5 month)

### SETUP PROJECT IN GITHUB AND VISUAL STUDIO CODE

#### GITHUB

- We used GitHub for version control throughout our project. Each developer was assigned dedicated issues. They proceeded to name their branch according to the issue they were working on their branches (e.g., trang-navbar). Khoa and Quan reviewed our code so the code is as clean and as scalable as possible. Following a comprehensive review, the code was integrated into the development branch.
- Our effort was directed towards maintaining the developed branch as the pinnacle of stability among working branches. In instances where a push to this branch encountered errors and bugs during testing, our team undertook the necessary measures to rectify the situation.

#### VS CODE

- In our VS Code environment, we initiated the project by creating a well-organized folder structure for both the client and server sides. To speed up coding, we utilized Copilot which greatly boosted code generation and made our development process more efficient.
- In addition to Copilot, we integrated the Prettier extension into our VS Code setup. This step was crucial to ensure consistent code formatting across the entire project.

### IMPLEMENTATION

#### FRONTEND

- We decided to make use of React framework for our front-end development
- Thanks to the React workshop hosted by anh Khoa, we, inexperienced developers, knew the general set up of React to work with, such as using Bootstrap, Reactstrap, etc.
- Later on, we discovered Material UI, which is our main library for styling our web more conveniently compared to styling with css for all the components.
- For the charts in the dashboard page, we utilize this library https://recharts.org/en-US/, however, there’s a downside for this library is that they don’t have the ‘title’ prop to go with the chart.
- Transactions page: we see the need of list view (option of view as table and view as visualization) hence we implement them.
- For the transaction card in Grid view, we intend to let users store the receipt virtually, hence by making each transaction hold an image of the receipt, users don’t have to worry about losing their receipt.
- We made use of Firebase Authentication to verify users’ credentials. We decided to use this because it saved more time than actually coding the logic to verify the users’ credentials under limited time. When calling endpoints to sign up/in, it will save the users’ data to the database and will be in charge of verifying whether that credential is valid or not and return for us userID or error if invalid.
- Beside Firebase Authentication, we used Firebase Storage to store users’ images. When users upload their images, it will be saved in the Storage and return for us an URL link to that image, we will take that URL and store it in our database, which will have a field to capture the image URL, that is where we store the URL in that. Therefore, whenever we get a transaction, it will come with an URL directing us to the image stored in Storage, so that we can display it on screen.
- Context API is used to manage the state more efficiently since we didn’t have time to learn Redux.
- Chatbot (UI): This is one of our core features, this chatbot can parse user input and return insight about transactions, categories, bucket and monthly transaction. It utilizes the natural language processing model from OpenAI and our little trained model.

#### BACKEND:

- Firstly, we had two options to build the database: MongoDb and PostgreSQL. After considering the convenience of implementing the project and the opportunity to learn new tech stacks, we decided to use PostgreSQL and Prisma Client. These were new tools for us, so it was a chance to implement and learn.
- To start setting up the database for the project, we created a PostgreSQL Database with Prisma's Data Platform. Prisma provides an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) layer that allows us to interact with the database using programming language constructs and concepts, rather than using plain SQL. Once this setup was completed, all the logic for interacting with the database was written using Prisma's syntax. This helped us save a lot of time during the development of endpoints in the following steps.
- To fit within the project's three-month scope, we chose to write around 30 endpoints covering CRUD operations and essential calculations for wallets and transactions. To make implementation, debugging, and maintenance more convenient, we categorized all the endpoints into the following features: Transaction, Wallet, Filter, Calculation for transactions, and Authentication. We thoroughly tested all endpoints using Postman to ensure they function correctly, even with edge cases.

### HOW TO WORK EFFECTIVELY AS A TEAM

- Know each other strengths and weaknesses so you can define roles, responsibilities and tasks
  Clear communication is a top priority, make sure your work doesn’t overlap with other members.
- Set target commitment time
- Leader plays an essential role
- Conflict resolution is essential. Disagreements can arise

## SIDE NOTE

If we have the chance to go back to time, here is what we would do instead

- Don’t leave it until the last minute (or you will have to speedrun 🙂 at the end).
- Choose the best mode of contact for your team. Initially, we used Discord but we usually missed the notifications.
- Effective communication, spill out your ideas and discuss with your team. Don’t leave it until everyone has completed their task and changed the entire structure without communicating with your teammates.
- Pair programming: this will save your life and time. You will definitely learn a lot from your teammates.
- Always keep your PR small or your leader aka Quan Le will cry :))
