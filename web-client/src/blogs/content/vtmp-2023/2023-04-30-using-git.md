## Setup your project

#### Clone the repository

```bash
# Clone the repository down to your laptop
git clone git@github.com:khoa165/your-repo-name.git
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
# Only if your project is using Node.js
npm install
# Depending on your project's setup, you might need to install dependencies for client side as well (your team likely uses React for frontend)
cd client
npm install

```

## Development flow

#### Create a branch

```bash
# Every time you work a new feature
git checkout -b add-users-dashboard
```

#### Stage your changes

```bash
# Add changes from a single file
git add src/components/LoginForm.js

# Add all changes
git add .
```

#### Commit your changes

```bash
git commit -m "Give it a succint but meaningful message here to describe your change"
```

#### Push your changes

```bash
# Pushing to master (should never be used when working in a team)
git push origin master

# Pushing to your current branch
git push origin HEAD

# When you push the newly created branch for the first time, add the -u flag so that your local branch you push is automatically linked with the remote branch.
git push origin HEAD -u

# For subsequent push, you could also just do
git push

# Sometimes you might need to force it to override the remote state, use -f flag to force push. This might override remote changes if someone else on your team previously pushed to that same branch
git push origin HEAD -f
```

## Other helpful Git/non-Git commands

#### List local branches

```bash
git branch
```

#### Check state of code

```bash
git status
```

#### List files/directories in your current directory

```bash
ls

# To see files/directories that start with a dot, e.g. .git
ls -al
```

#### Print current working directory

```bash
pwd
```

#### Create a directory

```bash
# Create folder components inside src folder
mkdir src/components
```

#### Create a file

```bash
# Create a file named DashboardBanner.js inside components folder
touch src/components/DashboardBanner.js
```
