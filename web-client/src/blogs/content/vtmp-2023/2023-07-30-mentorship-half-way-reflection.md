## [REFLECTION] VIET TECH MENTORSHIP PROGRAM HALF-WAY

### TL/DR

Just wanna share the results of our first half of Viet Tech mentorship program and looking back at the past 4 months since we launched this initiative. Zoom recording of mentees' presentation & demo is at the end. Attached screenshot is a highlight of 3 groups' web apps.

### HOW DID WE GET STARTED?

As some of you might have known, Viet Tech has been experimenting with our first iteration of the mentorship program. When we opened the application back in February, we received interest from over 200 submissions. At the time, Huy Anh planned to take 1 mentee, Nguyen Vu planned to take 1 mentee and I planned to take 2 mentees.

Time flies and here we are today with 12 mentees in total. From the application stage, we selected applicants who submitted thoughtful responses to our questions and whom we can actually make a difference to their growth. There were 19 candidates who moved forward to the interview round, which we seeked to understand and relate to the potential mentees, while making sure we could provide the proper support to them if we were to take them. Even though the plan was to take 3-4 mentees, as Nguyen and I sat through all 19 interviews, their stories resonate with us a lot that we discussed and decided to take more than the original plan.

Our mentor includes anh Chan Le (mentee: Minh Quân), Huy Anhh (mentees: Đăng & Trang Vu), Vũ Thanh Nguyên (mentees: Phương Ngọc, Gia Phước & Hieu Vuong), Khoa Le (mentees: Truc Truc, An Khue Tang, Viet Cuong Nguyen Ba & Thanh Nguyen), Anh Pham (co-mentee Hieu with Nguyen and Robin with Khoa), Kevin (mentees: TuyetHoa Quach & Minh Phuong Cao). Each mentor has been responsible for helping our mentees with setting direction, suggesting action plans, and providing resources through 1-1 recurring meetings. Mentors have also shared resources to all mentees in the program through our Discord channels, which Quach Tuyet Hoa (Jenny) has helped us consolidate and share with the community.

Mentees were selected in the beginning of April and our program kick-off took place a week after that. As we all know, there are 2 steps to land an internship/new grad offer. The first step, which is a lot more difficult, is to get an interview, which enables the second step, passing the interview. The first half of the program has been focusing on preparing and setting the mentees up for a successful recruiting season.

### Building skillset

To land an interview, you typically have to pass the resume screening round. With our mentorship program’s initial criteria of selecting mentees with little to no industry experiences (no previous internships), group projects play a key role in helping the mentees stand out in the eyes of recruiters.

The goal was to give them an opportunity to work together to build a substantial project. With different mentees at various levels when it comes to programming, I figured workshops were necessary to help upskill mentees, and at least give them some tools to contribute to the projects.

As I was the mentor overseeing all 3 group projects for 12 mentees and my domain has been mostly fullstack web, most of my workshops were specific to web development. Within 1 month after the program kick-off, the mentees have participated in various workshop

- Apr 22: basic HTML/CSS/JavaScript, covering concepts such as how to use a UI library (e.g. Bootstrap), flex concept in CSS, etc.
- Apr 23: basic React, covering concepts such as functional components, import and variables, usages of hooks (useState, useEffect), etc.
- Apr 30: how to work in a team effectively, introducing version control tools (GitHub), API tools (Postman), task tracking tools (GitHub, Trello), databases (e.g. MongoDB, Firebase), as well as articles that could help them set up their dev environment to be more productive.
- May 20: a walk-through of MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js), covering concepts such as database design (primary key, references, 1-1/1-n/n-n schema relationship), server development (controllers, API endpoints, request, response), client development (React, Redux/state management)

### Group project phase

Back before I finalized the matching for mentors-mentees, I went through all interviewees’ profiles, especially the resume, to make sure I had a good understanding of their skill set and proficiency in technology. Based on that, I divided the 12 mentees in 3 groups, each with a technical lead (who is a little more familiar with building personal projects outside of classes compared to the rest of the team). Luckily, we had just barely enough, exactly 3 mentees, that could take on the team lead role, helping me distribute the tasks and upskill other team members. I then divided the rest of the mentees to make sure each group has mentees from different mentors and with different backgrounds.

Each group was required to meet (over Zoom since mentees are scattered across the U.S.) to brainstorm a few potential ideas and I weighed in with my opinion on whether the ideas would be too simple or too complicated. Once each team made their pick, they put together some sort of document that outlines the problem and their solution, detailing user requirements and features by milestones with some stretch goals.

Over the course of 3.5 months, each group has met with me countless times, with the first few meetings focusing on picking technology (libraries, data sources, APIs) and designing their database schema as well as how to implement some core features at a high level. As they progressed, the meetings gradually shifted to smaller sizes of 1-1 or 1-2 where they wanted my help in pair programming or debugging tricky issues.

As the projects phase started heading into the final few weeks, I pitched the teams in a competition to earn prizes at the end where they would do a presentation and demo in front of our judges. The presentation took place just recently, on July 28th, with our mentors and a few invited guests from the admins/mods of Viet Tech to serve as judges. It was a huge success for the mentees but I also learned some lessons that I could have done better.

### WHAT WENT WELL?

I think some of the areas I did relatively well were workshops, team assignments, and picking team leads. These activities are crucial in making sure that all teams are divided fairly, and each mentee of the program has a fair shot to shine under proper support and guidance.

Presentation and demo was also a great opportunity for the mentees to showcase their work and also reflect on their learnings and growth that they have had. The majority of them had zero knowledge besides some intro classes in Java/Python in their college before this program, yet today, they have shown a tremendous growth both in technical proficiency and team work/communication skills. Honestly, as someone who has been looking after each of them for almost 4 months and knows their strengths and weaknesses by heart, I could not have been more proud of their progress, their effort, and their perseverance.

One of the best things that came out from this group projects phase is that it facilitates building a close-knit community naturally. I still remember for the first two months, it was mostly mentors sharing resources and our mentees pretty much just kept silent. As the project progressed, I noticed that each team began to start forming a camaraderie and building great friendships. When we started this mentorship initiative, our goals were to not only provide mentees with proper resources to succeed but also to give them a circle of network, professional relationships and hopefully also lasting friendships. I am happy that we are taking steps to get there.

### WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN IMPROVED AND/OR THINGS I NEED TO KEEP IN MIND FOR NEXT YEAR?

A few weeks into the projects, I realized that having a supportive technical lead is crucial to the success of each group project. While I tried my best to make myself available to help all 12 mentees, it is unhealthy and not scalable for me to spend hours helping them debugging code that I don’t directly write. I was fortunate to have just enough technical leads (Quan, Khue, Dang) that helped me review code and upskill the remaining team members. If we were running this again next year, this is something that we surely have to keep in mind.

As the group projects progressed, I realized that all teams struggle with a few common issues that I could have done better in the working in team workshop:

- Using Git properly: one of the most daunting issues mentees have to deal with is resolving Git conflicts. While I did cover basic Git workflows, including making a PR request (add, commit, push), updating local feature branch/resolving conflicts (pull main, checkout, merge/rebase), I now realized that the lack of practical and hand-ons activities translated to the fact that mentees did not remember what command to use when, leading to layers of Git conflicts every time they put up a PR. Attempting to resolve those conflicts themselves typically resulted in things getting out of hand, and them pinging me at weird hours sometimes.
  PR size: most teams discussed who worked on what during each meeting and mentees typically crammed everything into a single PR, leading to a giant number of code line changes. This made it frustrating for me and/or the tech lead of each team to give proper code review. As the projects progressed, I realized that people just started approving without really giving PRs the proper attention that they should.
- Hustling at the last minute: some teams did not necessarily get along at the beginning due to everyone’s unfamiliarity with tech stack and not understanding each other. Only towards the end of the group projects did each team start bonding better and speeding up their work. Last minute cramming of features led to numerous bugs, which caused stress right before presentation and demo.
- While the competition was a good idea to help each team gain some motivation and momentum to prepare for an amazing presentation and demo, there should be various winning categories to reward each team’s tremendous effort instead of the single winner structure we had this year.

### WHAT MENTEES HAVE BEEN UP TO BESIDE GROUP PROJECTS?

While the group projects were the focus of the first half, our mentees have also had the opportunities to upskill on other areas. So far, I have organized AMA (Ask me anything) with most of our mentors where:

- Kevin shared about his internships at Google and how his research experience related to Machine Learning led him to his current company, Gantry, where he started his career as a new grad Software Engineer earlier this year.
  Huy Anh answered questions on various topics, ranging from attending conferences, seeking referrals, preparing for interviews to landing and deciding offers, building Viet Tech community.
- Nguyen shed light on her conference experience and how she managed to win the Swift Student Challenge - WWDC twice, as well as how to make the most fun out of internship experiences.
  I deep dived into my internship experiences at Adobe, DoorDash and Snap, detailing how accidentally breaking production turned out to be the best thing for my Meraki internship.
  Recently, as companies start opening up applications, mentors and mentees have started discussing a lot about going to conferences (Greylock, Tapia, GHC, etc.). Each mentor has also met with their direct mentees to offer resume review and for some, mock interviews already. With interviews looming, I started hosting a weekly Leetcode contest in June, where interested mentees and I met every Saturday night to participate in the contest and I would go over the questions and explain how to tackle them afterwards (minus the hard questions :P). As to help the mentees increase their chance for interviews, Huy Anh also spearheaded the effort to seek referral from anh chị in Viet Tech on behalf of mentees to help boost their shot. Over the upcoming weeks, I will organize more workshops to help mentees prepare for behavioral, technical, basic system design, and practical interviews.

### FINAL THOUGHTS

As someone who navigated breaking into tech on my own, I definitely wish I hadn’t had to sacrifice almost every other aspect of my life just to hustle for internships and offers. As I have spent close to 150-200 hours on this program and the mentees so far, I realized that I want to be the mentor for them the same way I wish someone had looked out for me when I first started on my path to tech.
Words can’t express how truly proud I am of our mentees and I honestly couldn’t ask for a better set of mentees in our very first iteration of Viet Tech mentorship program. I started off thinking I would simply be responsible for just 4 mentees, and even doubting myself that I was over-committing at the time. And now 4 months and 12 mentees later, I learned and grew a lot with the mentor role.
Special thanks to the entire mentor team: Huy Anh, Nguyen Vu, Kevin Luu, Thu Anh, anh Chan Le and the admins/mods of Viet Tech. I couldn’t have run this group projects effort without their encouragement and support.
If you are interested in becoming a mentor or mentee of our program, stay tuned for updates from us as we plan to open for a new mentorship season in Feb 2024, pending the outcome and success of our first iteration.

### LINK TO PRESENTATION/DEMO RECORDING

If you might be interested in checking out what our mentees built over the course of 3 months, I put the recording link below.
Over the next few weeks, each team will put together a post to share about their unique group project journey and hopefully that could help provide insights for our Viet Tech community, especially freshman/sophomore who are struggling to get started with group projects.
