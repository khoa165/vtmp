## Recommended tools for group projects

- Version control system: Git + GitHub
- API tool: Postman
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js
- Frontend: React.js
- Database: MongoDB or Firebase
- Task tracking: Trello or GitHub Projects board

## Advices

- Don't accidentally commit secrets into your codebase, always use .env to store secrets and add .env to .gitignore
- Use cloud version for MongoDB (Atlas) to reduce friction in setting up local database, however, each person should create their own instance to avoid accidentally disrupting other people work
- Have a shared Postman folder/workspace
