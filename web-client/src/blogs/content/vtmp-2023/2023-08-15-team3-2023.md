📌 DUMMIES’ GUIDE TO BUILDING A FULL-STACK WEB APP FROM SCRATCH (part 1)📌

Hi! I'm Truc (Robin), a mentee in Viettech mentorship program. Our team, TuyetHoa, Đăng, Gia Phước, just wrapped up a group project: Productify, a gamified calendar and productivity platform built using MERN stack 😎

In this post, we'll reflect on our development journey and share some technical resources we personally found useful. Our aim is to offer insights into creating a full-stack web app for beginners. Since this project actually gave half of our team their first exposure to MERN stack, we hope this will be beneficial to those new to full-stack web development or software group projects in general. Stay tuned for part II where we dive deeper into how we built an interactive calendar from scratch!

We want to thank anh Khoa Le Thien for his close supervision, as well as our mentors Anh Pham Vũ Thanh Nguyên Huy Anhh Kevin Luu, and Viettech admins/mods for their support!

<p class="text-secondary fst-italic">Disclaimer: The insights shared are based solely on our personal experiences gained from working on one full-stack group project. The information provided is intended to be particularly useful for individuals at the beginner level who might find it challenging to initiate their journey. We welcome and greatly value any feedback you may have regarding the content! If you have any questions, please feel free to comment or message us!<p>

## 📕 CHALLENGES

Some challenges we faced as a team when starting out:

- Half of us were beginners to MERN stack in particular and web development in general.
  Some of us were also beginners to Git, which means it takes a while to streamline the collaboration process in the beginning.
- The whole team was spread across various time zones. The FE team was in Vietnam while the BE team was in two other timezones in the US. This makes scheduling meetings a little harder but actually inspired our project idea: 📖 a productivity ecosystem where we can schedule events, invite others to collaborate, and join study chat rooms together, all while earning points to compete on top users board! 📖

## 📕 PROCESS

### 📍 APRIL 2023: PRE-PLANNING

Thanks to anh Khoa for hosting introductory workshops on React and MERN stack, we started to familiarize ourselves with technical stacks.

On top of these workshops, each of our team members did individual research by completing basic tutorials (linked below).

### 📍 MAY 2023: PLANNING

We started out by considering our goals (what we want from this project) and expectations (what we can contribute).

- With these in mind, at the finish line:
  - Each team member should:
    - Be proficient in Git
    - Deepen insights into their assigned field (FE/BE) while dipping their toes in fullstack development
    - Get involved in various stages of software development pipeline
    - Learn project management
    - Collaborate smoothly
  - Group project should be:
    - Highly applicable
    - Full-stack
    - Feasible in 3.5 months
- We also set the expectations that each member’s time commitment will be >20 hours/week.
- We then set soft/hard deadlines for each stage of development. For example, our soft deadline for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is mid-June while the hard deadline is in mid July where we would present the final product to all mentors.

We went on to assign subteams:

- We have a technical lead that will oversee all development.
- We then split 4 members into 2 teams: Backend/Frontend, based on personal preferences and potential for contribution. <b> 🎁 TIPS: Identify each members strengths and weaknesses + interests. If possible, if you are thinking about forming a team, try to get teammates with diverse skill sets (for example, our team has one experienced in backend, one in frontend, one familiar with Git, and one with UI/UX skills)</b>

With this team ensemble, we brainstorm and pitch potential web app ideas to each other and mentors for feedback. For each pitch:

- Have a shared document to list out all the possible ideas (even the craziest ones) then start to narrow down to the best one (based on technical feasibility and user story). For each idea, try to answer:
  - What makes this web app stand out from what already exists out there?
  - What is the mission and vision of this app and who does it serve?
  - What technical skills do we need to develop this app?
  - What features does this app have?

At this stage, it’s also essential to go over housekeeping rules:

- Set up weekly meetings with clear agendas. <b>🎁 TIPS: be mindful of others’ time difference but also be prepared for potential ad-hoc meetings.</b>
- Assign note takers (important during project planning for mentors’ feedback on pitches and project design)
- Set up shared working environment (Google docs, Github, communication channels, etc.) This streamlines communication and ensures everyone knows where to look and whom to contact if they need anything.

<p class="text-secondary fst-italic">Output of planning stage:</p>

- Finalized tech stack: are you gonna use NoSQL or SQL database, Typescript or Javascript, any additional technologies (Docker), etc.
- Finalized project idea: vision, mission, target audience
- List of features: ranked from must-have, should-have, could-have, wont-have. <b>🎁 TIPS: think about what features your MVP will have at the bare minimum.</b>
- Team assignment: who will work on what features?
- Very basic tasks assignment on Github Project Board
- Product timeline: estimated time for each feature, sprint deadlines
- Streamlined workflow and workspaces

### 📍 MAY 2023: DESIGNING

After fleshing out logistical issues, it’s time to plan out our web app!

- Structure-wise: envision what attributes our app will have
  - System design: What are the necessary API endpoints, etc.?
  - Database design: will it have one-to-many, many-to-many relationships? what fields will each variable in the schema include, etc.?
- Visuals-wise: imagine what the app will look like
  - Style guide:
    - Basic features (logo, favicon, color palette, typography, spacing)
    - Design system (UI component design (form design, background color, border attributes, etc.), interaction design (hover state, focus state, disabled state etc.) and how they respond to different browser sizes
    - Accessibility features (compliant with WCAG standards)
  - Figma wireframe (low fidelity: just boxes and text to convey what a web page’s structure looks like conceptually) –> mockup (added logo, icons, colors) –> prototype (high fidelity: basically what the final product will look like down to the pixel of a clicked button, without any functionality)

<p class="text-secondary fst-italic">Output of designing stage: finalized product planning and design docs</p>

- System & DB schema
- UI/UX style guide for future reference
- High fidelity prototype designed in Figma

### 📍 JUNE 2023: EXECUTING

📆 First sprint: setting up to ensure universality of code styles and practices

- The assigned technical lead will set up a codebase including creating a github repo and React app along with adding seed file for testing and ESLint/Prettier for styling. After this is done, the technical lead should walk every member through the folder and files structure and make sure everyone understands the flow of the code.

📆 Second sprint: mixed collaborating

- Collaboration within subteams (FE/BE). At the very beginning, FE team coded up static page elements while waiting for the BE team to set up some basic CRUD API endpoints. During this phase, since we aimed to build the calendar page from scratch, the FE team also spent a lot of time perusing through tutorials on this feature. As the BE team moved on to more calendar-specific endpoints, the FE team was already ready to add functionalities to those hitherto static pages. <b>🎁 TIPS: Kudos to Liveshare (a VSCode extension for real-time code sharing and debugging): imagine live coding on your teammates’ computers even though they are half the globe away!</b>
- Code review and merging pull requests
- As our repo is up on Github, we have decided that our main branch will be protected and can only be merged through PR (pull request) with at least 2 approvals. As team members get their assigned tasks through Github issues, they will branch out from the main branch to work on their features and make a pull request with a detailed description and video to demonstrate the updates when it is ready to be reviewed.
- Team members will then thoroughly review each other's code and give constructive comments. If everything is good to go, we will approve each other's code and merge all the pull requests together during our weekly meeting.

🎁 TIPS for Git newbies:

- Github cheat sheet
- Don’t have too much branches (clean up branch after merged)
- Don’t wait til the PR get too big to merge
- Write meaningful reviews, don’t just blindly approve for your teammate
- Always make sure that you are not working on the main branch, always pull and make sure your project is running fine before you start.
- Always solve conflict by IDE VsCode (not Github Text)
- Planning out incoming tasks on project board and assign issues. TIPS: alternative options for project management platforms include Asana, Trello, Jira, etc. We just used Github board to centralize our virtual workspaces.

📆 Third sprint: pair programming.

- This is specific to our (very small-sized) team, where all members collectively want to take ownership of a fullstack feature and/or work crossfunctionally. Beginner project groups can just continue working in FE/BE subteams separately. <b>🎁 TIPS: rank features (FE heavy/BE heavy) and have team members pick tasks suited to their strengths and personal preferences for learning.</b>
- Initially, we planned office-hours-style work for the sprint to speed up development. For instance, a BE expert would handle BE-heavy tasks solo, and interested team members could join Zoom calls for observation and feedback. However, since we completed many features before MVP deadlines and had extra time, we flipped the approach to maximize each member’s technical growth in fullstack. For instance, Truc, a frontend person, tackled backend for the leaderboard, while Jenny, assigned to be in backend team, got converted into a frontend enthusiast through collaborative work on avatar customization. Meanwhile, Dang, leading backend, deepened frontend skills with the study room, and Phuoc exhibited flexibility by handling various calendar features with both FE and BE code.

### 📕 LEARNINGS FOR NEWBIES

Some tips that worked out for us and might be helpful for other newbies:

- Tutorials are helpful when you are absolute beginners but we found that learning happens best on the job, so no pressure to master a certain technology before jumping in.
- Remember why you started! Please set a clear purpose and expectations for everyone from the get-go. Be accountable for everyone’s time and efforts!
- Communication is key!!! Make sure to always update your progress with your teammates. Also make it a routine to report on what you are doing to mentors so they can potentially help you out.
- Understand the strengths of each member and don’t hesitate to ask for help when you are stuck. USE YOUR TEAMMATES! For code explanations, for walking you through a new technology, or just for some emotional support while you cry your eyes out over a random bug 😅 We actually have never appreciated the 12-hour timezone difference more: someone was always available 24/7!
- ChatGPT and Stackoverflow are your friends 💅
- DID I MENTION USE YOUR TEAMMATES?
- Make the team meetings fun and enjoyable! We could just code up a project for our resumes and never talk to each other again after - but we actually had so much fun learning from and about each other (by meeting on an excessive basis) and formed a small yet tight-knitted support circle!
- Find yourself some motivation: plan a virtual group boba date when the project is finished, or in our case, make the motivation financial _cough_ (thanks Viettech hackathon!)
- Last but not least, believe in yourself (and your teammates, and ChatGPT) and just start doing. You will be impressed by how far you can go!
